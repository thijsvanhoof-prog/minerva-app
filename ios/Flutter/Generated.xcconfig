// NOTE:
// Flutter normally generates this file during `flutter pub get`.
// Xcode Cloud archives can fail early if this file is missing, because
// ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig and Release.xcconfig include it.
//
// This committed fallback keeps Xcode Cloud unblocked. In CI we also run
// `flutter pub get` and `pod install` (see ci_scripts/ and the [CI] build phase),
// which may regenerate this file. That is fine.
//
// Important: avoid absolute paths here (so it works on any machine/CI).
